üåê Neon DB

- Neon is a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database (like Supabase but focused only on Postgres).

- It‚Äôs built to be serverless, scalable, and developer-friendly.

- Key features:
    - Serverless Postgres ‚Üí you don‚Äôt manage servers; Neon automatically scales up or down depending on traffic.

    - Branching ‚Üí like Git branches, but for databases. You can ‚Äúbranch‚Äù your database to test changes safely, then merge back.

    - Autoscaling + cold starts ‚Üí if your app is idle, Neon pauses to save costs, then wakes up when needed.

    - Modern UI + API ‚Üí makes managing Postgres easier (no need for heavy DevOps work).

- So Neon = ‚ÄúPostgres, but modern and serverless.‚Äù

‚ö° Serverless PostgreSQL - Normal PostgreSQL needs a server running 24/7. - Serverless PostgreSQL (like Neon‚Äôs version) removes that burden: - No need to provision servers. - It scales automatically (more connections = more resources).
Perfect for apps with unpredictable traffic (startups, side projects, SaaS MVPs).

## üîç Technology Choice Questions
